# Market Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing K-means clustering for market segmentation using Python. The goal was to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant attributes. By doing so, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to different customer segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **K-means Clustering Implementation**: Used the K-means algorithm to segment the market into distinct groups.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved a notable accuracy rate of 96%.
- **Visualization**: Provided visual representations of the clusters for better understanding and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.

## Results
The project successfully segmented the market into distinct clusters with an accuracy rate of 96%. The visualizations provided clear insights into the customer segments, enabling businesses to develop targeted marketing strategies.
